    <abstract id="aspace_b418ab4af59bc2e56eee952adfb71ddb">Founded in 1987, Refuse &amp; Resist! (R&amp;R!) was a New York City human rights activist group which organized demonstrations and protests for issues related to prisoner rights, immigrants, and reproductive rights. The organization was active until 2006. The Refuse &amp; Resist! Records (1986-2008) contain material created and collected by the organization in the form of paper files, born-digital files, and audiovisual recordings. These files and recordings provide documentation for the administration of the national office; their state and city chapters; and their Artists' Network and Youth Network. These files include informational booklets, fact sheets, ephemera, press clippings, correspondence, issues of R&amp;R!'s publication <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>, as well as recordings and promotional material for events including their National Conference, Resist in Concert!, and National Day of Appreciation for Abortion Providers. The organization's archived website is also in this collection. Material related to the separate activities of R&amp;R!'s Artists Network and Youth Network are almost entirely focused on events and protests related to the Mumia Abu-Jamal death penalty case.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Established in New York City in 1987, Refuse &amp; Resist! was a human rights activist group founded by Emile de Antonio, Dore Ashton, Dennis Brutus, John Gerassi, William Kunstler, C. Clark Kissinger, Conrad Lynn, Sonia Sanchez, Rev. Fernando Santillana, and other activists. The organization's distinctive logo was created by artist Keith Haring in 1988. The group organized protests and demonstrations for various issues including immigration rights, reproductive freedom, anti-war, police brutality, prisoners' rights, and the death penalty, specifically supporting on a large scale the Mumia Abu-Jamal case. 
The organization's national office was located in New York City, however, over 30 local chapters were formed at the city and state level at various times in the history of the organization, including Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Cleveland, Ohio; New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. They also formed other groups to support all their causes, including the Artists Network and Youth Network, both heavily involved in protesting the Mumia death penalty case. Refuse &amp; Resist! officially dissolved in 2006.</p>  </bioghist>
