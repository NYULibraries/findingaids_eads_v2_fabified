    <abstract id="aspace_5d346a56d636ed17aad3b1bca3e4c084" label="Abstract">The New York Taxi Workers' Alliance was founded in 1998 by members of the Lease Drivers Coalition (LDC), an advocacy project of the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV). The union, led by Executive Director Bhairavi Desai since its inception, fights for structural change in the taxi driving industry, regularly ranked by the Department of Labor as one of the most dangerous job in the country. The NYTWA supports drivers through legal advocacy, health benefits, and numerous campaigns fighting for safety and economic justice for taxi workers. Because taxi drivers are considered independent contractors, they cannot engage in collective bargaining. Despite this impediment, the NYTWA claims it has increased taxi drivers' incomes by 35%-45%, including implementation of the first-ever Living Wage standard for US taxi drivers in 2004. 

The records of the New York Taxi Workers' Alliance document the organization from its growth out of the Lease Driver Coalition (an initiative of the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence) in 1998 to its 2012 status as a national union and a member of the AFL-CIO in 2010. The records illusrtate the growth of the union in membership, funding, and media coverage, and the specific challenges of 21st century labor organizing in a transient and ethnically diverse population. The collection primarily documents the two major activities of the union: campaigns and legal services.</abstract>

    <head>New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) History</head>
<p>The New York Taxi Workers' Alliance was founded in 1998 by members of the Lease Drivers Coalition (LDC), an advocacy project of the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV). The union, led by Executive Director Bhairavi Desai since its inception, fights for structural change in the taxi driving industry, regularly ranked by the Department of Labor as one of the most dangerous job in the country. The NYTWA supports drivers through legal advocacy, health education, and numerous campaigns fighting for safety and economic justice for taxi workers. Because taxi drivers are considered independent contractors, the union cannot engage in collective bargaining.</p><p>Despite this limitation, the NYTWA uses legislation, work-stoppage strikes, demonstrations, and petitions to affect change. They mobilize drivers and build membership through meetings, outreach and fairs in airport waiting lots, industry research, organizational partnerships, and assisting drivers with tickets and fines. The NYTWA claims it has increased taxi drivers' incomes by 35%-45%, including advocating for the implementation of the first-ever Living Wage standard for US taxi drivers in 2004. </p><p>In May 1998, four months after their formation, the NYTWA organized a 24-hour strike of thousands of licensed taxi drivers in protest of proposed Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) regulations that would quadruple liability-insurance costs, increase fines and probationary periods for new drivers, and increase the frequency of drug and alcohol testing for drivers. The NYTWA demanded a moratorium on the new rules, an in-depth study of the taxi industry, and an end to double ticketing (the practice of issuing multiple tickets at the same time for similar driving infractions). Though the strike did not affect immediate change on TLC regulations, it was influential because it solidified the NYTWA as a union and was able to bring together workers from a notoriously segmented group with no central point of organization.</p><p>Early organizing activity for the union includes City Council Bill 472, which fought against TLC codes of conduct for drivers (primarily regarding license revoking procedures) which the council ruled to be "onerous" on drivers. Another early campaign fought against the long wait times drivers faced at the Queen Boulevard TLC Office, which took valuable time out of a drivers' average 60-hour work week. The NYTWA focused their efforts in the early 2000s on studying the impact of September 11, 2001 on taxi drivers and New York City immigrants and subsequent relief efforts (including federal disaster assistance for taxi drivers).  </p><p>During the mid-2000s, the union focused on the detrimental effects new taxi technology (malfunctioning credit card machines, the loss of 5% on fares from credit card use, and GPS tracking) had on driver earnings and individual rights. They also worked to raise the wages of drivers through economic justice campaigns, which fought for fare increases, caps on the cost of leasing cars and medallions, and for a fuel surcharge on all fares. </p><p>Union activity in the late 2000s concentrated on health initiatives; Intro 705, a bill which allowed drivers to choose credit card machine operators; and the Taxi Driver Protection Act, which called for heavier penalties for assaults on drivers and a sticker in each taxi warning of these penalties. </p><p>The NYTWA also spends much of its resources on providing discounted or pro bono legal, financial management, and health services for its members. The NYTWA claims a membership of 16,000 drivers and was voted into the New York City Central Labor Council in 2007 as the first non-collective bargaining agent member of a Central Labor Council in the US.  Together with the Taxi Workers Alliance of Pennsylvania, the union hosted a conference of international taxi unions in 2007, which resulted in the creation of the National Taxi Workers Alliance, now headquartered at the NYTWA. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>History of Taxicabs in New York City</head>
<p>Despite the iconic status of yellow cabs in the city of New York, documentation of the industry and its workers is sparse. The transitory nature of the industry and its history of union creation, corruption, and short-lived organizing efforts made it both hard to organize, and hard to document. Henry Allen started the first taxi fleet in New York City in 1907 (The New York Taxicab Company), with the first organizing and strike efforts taking place just one year later over the cost of uniform rentals and gas prices. </p><p>By the Great Depression there were more cabs on the streets of New York than there are in 2013 (about 16,000 in 1932 compared to 13,000 in 2013). To regulate this number, the city passed the Haas Act and introduced the medallion system. A medallion licenses a car to pick up and taxi passengers in New York City. By restricting the number of medallions, rather than driver licenses, the city can regulate the number of taxicabs on the streets of New York. More than half of the medallions created went to fleet owners who rent cars and medallions to licensed drivers for two shifts a day. The rest of the medallions were reserved for driver-owners, who are required to drive for a certain number of shifts before they can lease the medallion. The Act allowed for the transfer of medallions between owners and since the number of medallions did not increase until 1996, the cost increased exponentially. The cost was around $10 in 1937. By 2012, medallions sold for almost $1 million.</p><p>In 1971, the city created the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to regulate the taxi and limousine industry, which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the New York City police department. The TLC is in charge of licensing and regulating the taxi industry while the NYPD enforces traffic laws. Thus, New York City taxi drivers must be aware of the rules and regulations of several agencies: The Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). </p><p>In 1979, the city legalized the leasing system. This system chaged drivers' status from employee to independent contractor. Instead of receiving a percentage of the days' earnings, drivers now pay a set amount to lease the car and medallion for the day or week. Over the next few years, all garages moved to the leasing system. Since then, taxi drivers lease cars (and their medallions) from fleet garages or brokers by the day or by the week. A "DOV" driver (Driver Owned Vehicle) owns their vehicle but rents the medallion from the broker. By 2011, there were over 13,000 medallions and almost 50,000 licensed cab drivers. Since the retirement of the iconic "checker cab" in New York, most taxicabs were Ford Crown Victorias, one of the cheapest options of the TLC-approved cars until the 2010s. Because the Crown Victoria was discontinued in 2011, the TLC and Mayor Bloomberg introduced the Taxi of Tomorrow plan, which plans to replace all existing cars with an approved Nissan design from 2013-2018. The plan was controversial because the approved Nissan was neither an hybrid, nor was it wheel-chair accessible. </p><p>The taxi industry has always employed the recent immigrant population in New York City, though the proportion of drivers born outside of the U.S. increased dramatically in the last quarter of the 20th century. By 2005, less than 10% of drivers were born inside of the U.S. and the majority came from the South Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. This demographic composition has a wide-ranging impact on the industry and its patterns of organizing.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Due to the nature of the NYTWA office, many of the records came to the archive loose or in unlabeled folders. The original order did show some grouping based on NYTWA campaigns and organizing efforts, and the collection was organized and given folder titles by the archivist with these groupings in mind. The collection was rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes. Photographs were removed from albums and developing envelopes and placed in protective sleeves in the same order. Descriptive information on post-it notes were photocopied and replaced. </p><p>Some of the folders in this collection contained personal information such as names, license numbers, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and hack numbers. This information was redacted with permanent marker in instances where this could be easily done without compromising the information contained in the records.</p><p>In 2014, the archived website was added as Series IV. Additional websites were added in 2023-2024.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The records of the New York Taxi Workers' Alliance document the organization from its growth out of the Lease Driver Coalition (an initiative of the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence) in 1998 to its 2012 status as a national union and a member of the AFL-CIO in 2010. The records illusrtate the growth of the union in membership, funding, and media coverage, and the specific challenges of 21st century labor organizing in a transient and ethnically diverse population. The collection primarily documents the two major activities of the union: campaigns and legal services. The archived websites cover both their campaigns and legal services.</p><p>Without collective bargaining, campaigns are the major way the NYTWA affects change in the industry. Since its founding in 1998, the NYTWA has initiated numerous campaigns working toward increasing the wage of drivers, advocating for driver health and safety, fighting against TLC rules and regulations, and increasing public awareness of industry issues. The NYTWA provides discounted or pro-bono legal assistance to aid drivers in understanding and navigating the constantly changing traffic regulations and complicated TLC court system, in addition to the multiple city agencies they contend with on a daily basis, The Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). </p><p>Materials that document these campaigns include New York City Council outreach, flyers and distribution materials for drivers and the general public, proposed bills and legislation, internal workplans, industry research and clippings, and driver surveys. The records document their interactions with the media, drivers, the NYTWA Organizing Committee, and partnerships with related organizations. </p><p>Through these records, researchers can find information about evolving transportation technologies, the impact of September 11, 2001 on South Asian workers and the transportation industry, taxi drivers in the media, the rising cost of medallions, the effects of the legal system on the immigrant population of New York, changing traffic laws and restrictions, industry-specific health concerns, and efforts to educate the public about the industry. </p><p>Also represented in this collection are the many organizations that operate within the taxi industry. The NYTWA is the only group that advocates for and consists of taxi drivers themselves. There are several realted organizations that fight for taxi garages and medallion owners, including The Metropolitan Taxi Cab Board of Trade (MTBOT), Committee for Taxi Safety, and Greater New York Taxi Association. Over time, the NYTWA's working relationships with related organizations evolved. In particular, the NYTWA works more closely with the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) under the leadership of Commissioner Yassky (2010-2017), in comparison with Commissioner Daus (2001-2010). The NYTWA also initiated partnerships with other organizations to aid in campaign work and research projects, including the Brennan Center for Justice, the National Immigration Law Center, and the Urban Justice Center.  </p><p>Due to the small size of the NYTWA office staff and its use of email and phone communication, the collection contains little documentation of internal office interactions. This is also apparent in the lack of internal structure visible in the records themselves. Operating with only a few full time employees, the small staff performed all tasks in the organization – answering phones, doing research and outreach, writing articles, and attending meetings. Evidence of the fast paced office and makeshift orgnaizational strategies can be seen in the way that documents were used and reused. Most pieces of paper have been used for multiple purposes and passed through many hands – an unused flyer about one campaign became paper for taking notes about another. The documents reflect the nature of working in a reactive environment with less time for planning and internal organization. Instead, staff and volunteers for the NYTWA focused on how to affect the most change in a rapidly evolving industry. </p>  </scopecontent>

The series begins with organizing efforts of the Lease Driver Committee and the 1998 strikes that solidified the NYTWA as an organizing body. Materials that document these campaigns include New York City Council outreach, flyers and distribution materials for drivers and the general public, bills and legislation, internal workplans, industry research and clippings, and driver surveys.</p><p>Without collective bargaining, these campaigns show the many ways that the NYTWA advocated for change in the industry. The NYTWA focus their legislative and advocacy campaigns on immigrant rights, a living wage for drivers, the exploitative practices of fleet garages and brokers, and health and safety. Major campaigns include (in chronological order) City Council Bill 472, 9/11 impact studies and aid efforts, Fuel Surcharge, Economic Justice, Stop GPS, and the Taxi Driver Protection Act. </p><p>Economic Justice is a term the NYTWA used to describe campaigns in the mid-2000s that relate to raising the wage of taxi drivers through fare raises and lowering the cost of daily or weekly cab leasing. Campaigns relating to 9/11 use member surveys to document the effects of the event on driver income and treatment. These surveys and other research was used to advocate for Federal Emeregency Management Agency (FEMA) funds as well as housing rent assistance from the Bridge Fund. Stop GPS is the most well represented campaign in this series and spans 2004-2008. Stop GPS fought against malfunctioning credit card machines, the loss of 5% on fares from credit card use, and GPS tracking. </p><p>Health campaigns are interspersed throughout this series as new initiatives took place at different times throughout the union's tenure. Other minor campaigns advocate for drivers that have been injured or killed while driving, Ford Crown Victoria safety, the Queens Boulevard TLC Office Campaign, peace rallies, efforts to democratize TLC courts, immigrant rights, and taxi cab accessibility.

of the main services it provides to its members. It contains three types of legal documentation: advocacy cases for individual drivers, larger court, and legal research about topics including immigrant rights, traffic laws, and legal processes. The larger court cases were generally brought against the TLC as well as taxi garages and brokers. The research files attempt to navigate and understand the complicated rules and regulations placed on drivers from the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and the city of New York. </p><p>The advocacy cases represent much of the daily work of the NYTWA. Many members find out about and join the organization after seeking their legal help and advice. The office hours of the organization correspond with the schedule of drivers who experience a shift change around 5:00 am and 5:00 pm. Much of this time is spent speaking with drivers about appeals cases and fighting traffic tickets. These individual advocacy cases will be restricted until 2026 for privacy reasons.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_42ab0c40ff6139d8199e9838ccc6bb93"><head>Access Restrictions</head><p>Some material in Series II: Legal, relating to legal advocacy cases in support of individual members, have been redacted to ensure the privacy of these individuals.

id="aspace_be3a50458d34fc801a128a2e2d41d5eb"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This series contains the website for The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA). Crawling of the website began in 2009. From 2009 to early 2013, content of the website was collected, but the formatting was not successfully captured. During that time NYTWA focused on campaigns related to protections against credit card surcharges, accessible taxi dispatching, increase of the jet fuel tax, health insurance for taxicab drivers, the Taxi Driver Protection Act, fare overcharging, lease caps for medallions, yellow cab raises to 17% in 2012, the black car drivers strike, illegal pick-ups, and drivers relief and aid due to Hurricane Sandy at the end of 2012. In 2013, their website underwent a redesign. They focused on campaigns related to lease caps compliance, health and wellness, traffic rights, court rights, airport rights, the Owner Must Drive Rule, and repealing the MTA Tax. In 2015-2016, NYTWA worked on campaigns related to ride sharing apps to protect full time work for drivers, fair licensing standards and penalities, due process at the OATH Taxi courts, wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) training, and road infrastructure change. In 2017-2018, the website contained actions and statements related to President Trump's Muslim travel ban, #DeleteUber campaign, full-time job protections, congestion pricing exemptions, racial justice and civil rights iniatives, and suicide amongst taxi workers. In 2019 underwent another redesign, mostly just focusing on action alerts and news related to strikes and lawsuits against Lyft, Uber and other ride-sharing apps; debt forgiveness campaign; and the for hire vehicle (FHV) cap. In Spring 2020, taxi workers were considered essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the website included resource guides, information on unemployment insurance, financial assistance, health and safety, housing assistance, medallion debt forgiveness, remote learning, food assistance and other resources. The website also includes information on ongoing litigation related to wage theft, unemployment insurance, and drivers illegally being "logged off" Lyft. Other campaigns include raises for drivers by ride-share apps, license suspension class action law suit, and other policy proposals. The Twitter/X feeds document NYTWA's strikes against Uber over company's refusal to raise wages in 2022 as well as other news from the union.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_d3466ffca85015eff8cb56f784f0bbd3"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
