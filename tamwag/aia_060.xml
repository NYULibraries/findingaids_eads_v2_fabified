    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Ernie O'Malley (1897-1957) was an Irish Republican Army officer during the Irish War of Independence of 1919-1921 and a senior commander of the anti-treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War, 1922-1923. O'Malley wrote four books, <emph render="italic">On Another Man's Wound</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Singing Flame</emph>,  <emph render="italic">Raids and Rallies</emph>, <emph render="italic">Sean Connolly of Longford</emph> in addition to numerous poems, short stories, articles and reviews. A renaissance man, O'Malley was interested in art, archaeology, folklore, photography, literature and history, but also in the lives of those he fought with during the Irish Independence movement. In the 1950s he interviewed over 450 survivors of those he had fought along with, and these interviews were the basis for the episodes covered in his <emph render="italic">Raids and Rallies</emph> and <emph render="italic">Sean Connolly</emph>.</p><p>O'Malley was studying medicine at University College Dublin in 1916 when the Easter Rising took place.  Although  not a nationalist at the time, O'Malley having been invited by some friends to help defend Trinity College, Dublin in case the Irish Volunteers attempted to take it over, he decided his sympathies were with the rebels and thus began his military career.  When he went on the run in 1917, he was asked by Michael Collins to organize IRA brigade units throughout rural Ireland and later as a Commandant General, at age 24, he commanded the IRA's Second Southern Division in Munster with 7,000 men. O'Malley was captured twice during his military career, the first time by the British in Kilkenny in December 1920 after which he was interrogated and badly beaten.  With the threat of execution imminent he, and two other IRA men, escaped from Kilmainham Jail on February 14, 1921. At this arrest he had identified himself as 'Bernard Stewart' and when he escaped, his true identity was still unknown.  
O'Malley was captured a second time in the civil war on November 4, 1922 after a shoot-out with Free State troops in a house in Dublin. Critically wounded, he managed to survive prison for almost two years and 41 days on hunger strike before finally being released in July of 1924.  Although still not well, he decided to seek a warmer climate hoping to recover both physically and spiritually and traveled in Europe spending time hiking in the Pyrenes, museum hopping and self-studying art and architecture while constantly writing.  After returning to medical studies in Dublin for 1926-28, he was asked to go with Frank Aiken to the United States by Eamon de Valera to raise funds for the establishment of a new independent newspaper, <emph render="italic">The Irish Press</emph>.  His notes and impressions of these journeys, 1928-1935, are included in the collection in Notebook Series and elsewhere in the Correspondence Series. O'Malley settled in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico for 1929-1932 and while there met many artists and writers and occasionally lectured on modern Irish history and literature while writing his memoirs.  He also traveled extensively in Mexico in 1931 for nine months following his interests in folklore, archaeology, modern Mexican art and teaching,  - all the while writing. </p><p>In 1932 during the height of the Depression, O'Malley returned to New York to finish and publish his memoir, <emph render="italic">On Another Man's Wound</emph>.  With introductions from Paul Strand,  met many of the city's literary, theatre and artistic circles.  He continued to write articles, poems and short stories, but only his poems were published.  The manuscript for his memoir was rejected many times.  In the meantime with the change in government in Ireland, he became eligible for a pension for his military service and wounds, and this led to his return to Ireland to secure his pension.  While in New York he also met his future wife here, Helen Hooker, a sculptor and photographer, who had travelled extensively in Europe and Russia. Helen was the daughter of Elon Huntington Hooker, a wealthy businessman and founder of Hooker Electrochemical Company from Greenwich, Connecticut.  When he returned to Ireland in 1935 she followed him.  They married on September 27, 1935, and he returned to medical school. The couple settled initially in Dublin and later in County Mayo, Ireland, on a farm.  O'Malley continued writing and Helen continued her sculpture, photography and theatre interests.  The couple had three children.  After the marriage broke down in the late 1940s and Helen effectively returned to the United States, seized two of the children, Cathal and Etain, and brought then to America where she initiated divorce proceedings in 1950.  O'Malley's youngest son, Cormac, remained with his father.  The divorce was finalized in 1952.  After being in poor health for several years Ernie O'Malley died in 1957 in Dublin.  </p><p>During his lifetime, O'Malley published one critically acclaimed work about his experiences in the Irish War for Independence: <emph render="italic">On Another Man's Wound</emph>.  His second volume, <emph render="italic">The Singing Flame</emph>, covering the Civil War was only published posthumously. O'Malley had published a series of articles in <emph render="italic">The Sunday Press</emph> in 1955-56 describing his and other fighters' experiences, using the interviews he had conducted with former IRA men. These were also published after his death as <emph render="italic">Raids and Rallies</emph>. The collection includes this serialization as well as reviews and publicity on these works and others in the Clippings and Publicity Series.</p><p>In 1991, <emph render="italic">Prisoners: The Civil War Letters of Ernie O'Malley</emph> was published by his son Cormac and Richard English, the latter who also went on to write his biography, <emph render="italic">Ernie O'Malley: IRA Intellectual</emph> in 1998.  In 2007, Cormac edited and published <emph render="italic">No Surrender Here!The Civil War Papers of Ernie O'Malley, 1922-1924</emph>, being a compilation of anti-Treaty military communications and his father's letters from prison during the Civil War. Cormac also edited and published <emph render="italic">Rising-Out: Sean Connolly of Longford, 1890-1921</emph> in 2007.  <emph render="italic">Broken Landscapes: Selected Letters of Ernie O'Malley, 1924-1957</emph>, also co-edited by Cormac and Nicholas Allen was published in 2011.</p>  </bioghist>

Subseries A. Ernie O'Malley comprises literary manuscripts, articles, book reviews, essays, short stories, poetry, notes, drawings and speeches written or created by Ernie O'Malley between the years of 1926 and 1956.  Published and unpublished works, manuscript drafts, reprints and photocopies are represented.  A considerable amount of O'Malley's works were written during his travels throughout the United States and Mexico between 1928 and 1935.  A substantial portion of his literary output centers on his homeland, his military experiences during both the Irish War of Independence and Civil War, early Christian art in Ireland and Irish artists.  Other works reflect his interest in art, poetry and a variety of other topics.  Materials within the Works series are manuscript and/or typescript and are so indicated.  </p><p>Works by other authors are found in Subseries B. Other Writers. Throughout his life O'Malley collected ballads and poetry written by others.  While most of these materials were either transcribed by O'Malley himself or typed for his personal reference or use, several of the items are clippings or printed materials sent to him by friends and colleagues.  Poets within this series include both American and European poets such as Lascelles Abercrombie, Hart Crane, Emily Dickinson, Horace Gregory, James Joyce, Stanley Kunitz, Ezra Pound, Seamus O'Sullivan, John Millington Synge and numerous others.

The correspondence in this series is of a personal nature, detailing O'Malley's friendships and associations, as well as, a business nature documenting O'Malley's dealings with publishers, solicitors, and government agencies.  Throughout the course of his life O'Malley maintained friendships with notable artists, poets and writers in both Ireland and the United States.  Of special interest are the postcards and letters sent to O'Malley while he was imprisoned at Kilmainham Jail and Curragh Camp during the Irish Civil War in 1923 and 1924.</p><p>A limited number of items in this series are photocopies received from various universities, institutions, or private family collections at the request of Cormac O'Malley, Ernie O'Malley's youngest son.  Throughout the course of research on his father Cormac O'Malley also transcribed a considerable number of the letters written by Ernie O'Malley.  Those transcriptions have been included with the original or photocopy when available.  </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref162" level="file"><did><unittitle>Indices to Correspondence: Incoming (2 and

Topics in this series range broadly from general greetings to business dealings.  Many of the letters provide insight into O'Malley's ailments and failing health resulting from injuries he sustained during his military career.  Of special interest are letters O'Malley wrote concerning his work with the Irish Press in the United States and the status of his pension from the Irish government, as well as, transcriptions of letters from O'Malley to Monsignor John Hagan with O'Malley using the alias, Cecil Smyth-Howard, during his European travels in 1925 and 1926.  A substantial number of items in this series are photocopies received from various universities and institutions, at the request of Cormac O'Malley, Ernie O'Malley's youngest son.  Throughout the course of research on his father Cormac O'Malley also transcribed a considerable number of the letters written by Ernie O'Malley.  Those transcriptions have been included with the original or photocopy when available.  See accompanying index for a complete listing of correspondents indicating where originals are currently held, as well as, the volume of correspondence associated with each correspondent.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref326" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index to Correspondence: Outgoing</unittitle><unitid>cuid36711</unitid><unitid

Throughout the course of his life O'Malley, an avid reader, acquired a vast and diverse personal library.  Due to financial hardships during the late 1940s and early 1950s O'Malley was forced to sell a substantial portion of books from his personal library.  Card catalogs and inventories in this series reflect the many changes in his personal collection of books before and following the sale.  Of special interest is a collection of book slips from the National Library of Ireland, New York Public Library and Newberry Library in Chicago, Illinois documenting the hundreds of books O'Malley read or checked out from each institution during the 1930s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref463" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index to Personal</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17144</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">2010</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_e3b2c1c0550a2003de0e29a4362d0070" label="Mixed Materials [31142050296873]" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_e3b2c1c0550a2003de0e29a4362d0070" type="Folder">1A</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1624" level="file"><did><unittitle>Address Book: United States</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17145</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1928/1928" type="inclusive">1928</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_ee64949c4b5b7644ba5860af7bcee09f" label="Mixed Materials [31142054611812]" type="Box">42</container><container parent="aspace_ee64949c4b5b7644ba5860af7bcee09f" type="Folder">28</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref411" level="file"><did><unittitle>Address Books</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17146</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1944/1955" type="inclusive">1944-1955</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_4532db1cdf72b1bd4005c0471ff3313e" label="Mixed Materials [31142050296873]" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_4532db1cdf72b1bd4005c0471ff3313e" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref412" level="file"><did><unittitle>Address Books</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17147</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1950/1955" type="inclusive">1950-1955</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_045dfbe83eba72b4b71147544b659914" label="Mixed Materials [31142050296873]" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_045dfbe83eba72b4b71147544b659914" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1626" level="file"><did><unittitle>Address Book</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17148</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1953/1953" type="inclusive">1953</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_0ef16e6e520cbbeb8dc0358d244156aa" label="Mixed Materials [31142054611812]" type="Box">42</container><container parent="aspace_0ef16e6e520cbbeb8dc0358d244156aa" type="Folder">29</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref413" level="file"><did><unittitle>Catlogue of Printed Books: Southeby &amp;

Drawn to the nationalist cause in midst of the Easter Rising in 1916, O'Malley later joined the Irish Republican Army and became a key figure in the War of Independence and Irish Civil War.  Items in this series provide details of O'Malley's military career, as well as, insight into the publications and propaganda that powered the nationalist movement throughout Ireland.  Also included in this series are official reports and memoranda issued by Oglaigh na hEireann, otherwise known as the Irish Republican Army. Of special interest in this series are a few items relating to O'Malley's interviews with veterans of the War of Independence and Civil War.  Beginning in the early 1940s, O'Malley embarked on an ambitious effort to document first-hand accounts of both wars and as a result, hand-recorded approximately 450 interviews with his former military comrades.  Most items relating to his military interviews were placed in the archives of University College Dublin in 1974, however, a limited amount of materials pertaining to the interviews remain in this series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref466" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index to Nationalistic material</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17215</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">2010</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_46707d67d59331d77bc9ae09296350cf" label="Mixed Materials [31142050296881]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_46707d67d59331d77bc9ae09296350cf" type="Folder">12</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref467" level="file"><did><unittitle>Military Training Manual: <emph render="italic">Field Service Pocketbook</emph>,1914 with 1916 amendments (signed)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17216</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">1916</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_b23748f87906999e860dfb837757b63c" label="Mixed Materials [31142050296881]" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_b23748f87906999e860dfb837757b63c" type="Folder">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref471" level="file"><did><unittitle>Military Training Manual: <emph render="italic">Musketry Consisting of Theory of Rifle Fire  1.

Yeats, as well as, items relating to Yeats' father, John B. Yeats, and brother, William Butler Yeats.  Items in this series are of both a personal and professional nature.  O'Malley and Jack B. Yeats met in Ireland during the 1930s and developed a friendship that lasted until their deaths in 1957.  In addition to being a patron of Yeats' artwork, O'Malley served on the Jack B. Yeats National Loan Exhibition Committee and authored the introduction for the exhibition's catalog in 1945.  Throughout the course of their friendship Yeats gifted O'Malley various pencil sketches and writings by John B. Yeats, in addition to several letters written by the elder Yeats to his other son, William Butler Yeats.  Other items include Yeats materials collected by Ernie O'Malley's son, Cormac O'Malley.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref514" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index to Jack B.

Items in this series reflect the commentary, criticisms, critiques and general notes taken by O'Malley on a variety of topics including art, literature, poetry and history, and provide insight into his research methodology and writing process.  Most notebooks in this series are untitled, however, some notebooks bear the letters "P" indicating painting, or "I" for Ireland.

Many of the clippings, magazine articles and reprints were collected by O'Malley as research for his articles and essays on painting, sculpture, archeology, architecture and other related topics.  A substantial number of art catalogues and theatre programs were deposited at University College Dublin by O'Malley's son, Cormac O'Malley, in 1974.  Photocopies of the aforementioned items remain in this series, along with nearly 50 original art catalogues and theatre programs.  Also included in this series are more than 200 copies of photographs taken by O'Malley, Helen Hooker O'Malley and others from Mexico and Ireland.  Of special interest are notes taken by O'Malley during a series of interviews he conducted with organizers of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art during the 1940s.  O'Malley's interest in art criticism encouraged him to embark on series of interviews with some of Ireland's most prominent modern artists including, Evie Hone, Jack Hanlon, Louis le Brocquy, Norah McGuinness, Nano Reid and many others.  Works by other authors are filed at the end of this series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref775" level="file"><did><unittitle>Art Materials: Index</unittitle><unitid

Other items include correspondence, clippings, brochures, photographs, greeting cards, interview transcripts, audio reels, printed matter and other ephemeral material pertaining to topics or people associated with Ernie O'Malley or his son, Cormac O'Malley.  Throughout the course of his research on his father, Cormac O'Malley worked with his father's friends and their descendents, as well as, numerous universities, libraries, biographers and documentary film makers.  In 1970, Cormac O'Malley conducted a series of interviews with Madge and Jack Comer, Sigle Humphreys, Thomas and Peggy Malone, Sean Lemass, Peadar O'Donnell and George Gilmore documenting personal accounts and the military experiences of Ernie O'Malley.  The transcriptions of these interviews, as well as, three 1/4" audio reels are housed within this series.  Of special interest are materials collected by Ernie O'Malley relating to the Irish Press detailing his travels and expenses, in addition to, the funds he raised for the newspaper.  Many of the items in this series are photocopies of originals housed elsewhere in the collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref896" level="file"><did><unittitle>Subject Files: Indices (14 and 14A)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17779</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">2010</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_6e583d10f3e8b8e55cd14f0cf8adf779" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297038]" type="Box">22</container><container parent="aspace_6e583d10f3e8b8e55cd14f0cf8adf779" type="Folder">27</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref897" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aiken, Frank</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17780</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1982/2005" type="inclusive">1982-2005</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_3031c4c5fb0b6843be2efbd6fb79d138" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297038]" type="Box">22</container><container parent="aspace_3031c4c5fb0b6843be2efbd6fb79d138" type="Folder">28</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1483" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Indian Dance Festivals</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17781</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1929</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_e36c836b9c7c9b2b674b2e8ab8ff6825" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297038]" type="Box">22</container><container parent="aspace_e36c836b9c7c9b2b674b2e8ab8ff6825" type="Folder">28A</container></did><odd id="aspace_8ae960e929c1d5896a665e77203d062b"><head>General</head><p>Handwritten lists of American Indian dance festivals, including year, location, and tribe.

While most of the graphic items in this series are reprints or reproductions, several original cards, drawings and paintings from notable artists including Roy Boynton, and Jack Hanlon are also included.  Nearly twenty maps and nine letters either written by or addressed to historically significant Irishmen and women including Eva Gore Booth, Standish O' Grady, Sean O'Sullivan and Thomas Grattan complete the series as well as an undated historic account of the Spanish Armada's landing and an indenture for land dated 1857.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1083" level="file"><did><unittitle>Printed Ephemera Index</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17966</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">2010</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_d3eadd3064ea505f5f63d828f91d0145" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297087]" type="Box">27</container><container parent="aspace_d3eadd3064ea505f5f63d828f91d0145" type="Folder">35</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1084" level="file"><did><unittitle>Account: "Spanish Fleet Landing in Kinsdale, Ireland in 1601" handwritten, [John Blake Dillon?]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17967</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_b2f13a648df8b69a4e1324db1059cb9d" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297087]" type="Box">27</container><container parent="aspace_b2f13a648df8b69a4e1324db1059cb9d" type="Folder">36</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1572" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Adventures in Music" [Orchestral Concert Series]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17968</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">1946</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_a763ee02a2f47a797c841f6c3c0c6d0a" label="Mixed Materials [31142054611812]" type="Box">42</container><container parent="aspace_a763ee02a2f47a797c841f6c3c0c6d0a" type="Folder">23</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1126" level="file"><did><unittitle>Applegood, Frank G.: "Domingo" photocopy of engraving; Taos, NM</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17969</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">pre 1932</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_e4649533315cf30d6e2a794e0606889a" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297095]" type="Box">28</container><container parent="aspace_e4649533315cf30d6e2a794e0606889a" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1136" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Blasket Island from Dun Quin" (print of woodcut)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17970</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_de351ab000592cdcea6d58b0ebff6ac2" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297095]" type="Box">28</container><container parent="aspace_de351ab000592cdcea6d58b0ebff6ac2" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1088" level="file"><did><unittitle>Christmas card by Jack Hanlon, signed by artist</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/17971</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1945/1945" type="inclusive">circa 1945</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_19a2f016312e9c95f1fc97c4dbda67d4" label="Mixed Materials [31142050297087]" type="Box">27</container><container parent="aspace_19a2f016312e9c95f1fc97c4dbda67d4" type="Folder">40</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1089" level="file"><did><unittitle>Christmas card signed by Jack B.
