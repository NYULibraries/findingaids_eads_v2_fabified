    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Irish Repertory Theatre (IRT) was founded in New York, New York in 1988 by Charlotte Moore and Ciarán O'Reilly.  As of 2018, Moore is the Artistic Director and O'Reilly is the Managing Director.  The two met in the late 1980s in a Hudson Guild Theater production of Hugh Leonard's <emph render="italic">Summer</emph>, and decided to collaborate on a production of Sean O'Casey's <emph render="italic">The Plough and the Stars</emph> in September 1988.  Their profits from that production were enough to stage another show, and in this way the IRT was founded.  The IRT produces Irish and Irish-American plays and musicals year-round, both classics of Irish theater as well as new works by emerging Irish and Irish-American writers.  The Theatre moved to its current location, as of 2018, in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in 1995.  The IRT, its staff, and their productions have garnered critical acclaim and industry awards for their work.</p>  </bioghist>

Separation sheets were created to sustain the intellectual relationship between items.  </p><p>Paper material was housed in archival folders and boxes.  Physical digital media and audiovisual material were housed in archival boxes.  Duplicates in all formats were deaccessioned.  Preservation photocopies were created for material originally printed on thermal fax paper.  </p><p>Material in Series IV was determined to be protected under the attorney work-product doctrine.  This was separated from the collection in March 2018 pending a decision regarding its inclusion in the collection.  </p><p>In August 2019, duplicate material and off-air recordings were returned to the donor.
