    <head>Biography</head>
<p>The advent of Henry Mitchell MacCracken as sixth chancellor marked a turning point in the history of New York University.  MacCracken had been ordained as a Presbyterian minister, but he already had cast his lot with higher education.  In the late 1860s he had spent a year of study in Germany where he became acquainted with German practice in the development of graduate study.  Based upon this experience he would eventually stress the importance of adding postgraduate work to the curriculum in the arts and sciences at New York University.</p><p>Since 1880 he had been Chancellor of the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh). MacCracken came to New York University as Professor of Philosophy, but in June 1885, he was appointed Vice Chancellor.  The circumstances of his appointment made it clear that the Council of New York University and especially the acting Chancellor, the Reverend John Hall, were grooming the newcomer for the Chancellorship, which he assumed in 1891.</p><p>As Chancellor of New York University from 1891 until 1910, MacCracken oversaw the purchase of the University Heights Campus and the construction of the present-day Main Building at Washington Square.  He was also responsible for the reorganization of the Law School and the Medical School and the establishment of the Graduate School, the School of Pedagogy, the College of Engineering, the School of Commerce, and the Collegiate Division. In being both clergyman and educator, MacCracken symbolized the transition of the University from a small educational operation to one that in scope, organization, and administration laid the basis of the twentieth-century University.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Provenance</head>
<p>The administrative records of Henry Mitchell MacCracken were transferred from the Chancellor's office of New York University to Gould Memorial Library on the University Heights campus following the retirement of MacCracken in 1910. The records, including personal papers of MacCracken, were added to the New York University Historical Collection, which was housed in the Treasurer Room of the library. With the closing of the Heights campus in 1973, the Historical Collection was transferred to the Washington Square campus of the University, where it formed the nucleus of the University Archives.</p>  </custodhist>

MacCracken as his successor, miscellaneous correspondence, and annual reports. There is very limited documentation concerning the activities of John MacCracken as syndic or acting chancellor of New York University.</p><p>The University College material includes information about the classics, English and geology departments, and the chemical and physical laboratories. These files contain correspondence from faculty members, including Ernest G. Sihler, professor of Classics, Archibald Bouton, professor of English and later dean of University College, Morris Loeb of the chemical laboratory, and Daniel W. Hering, professor of Physics. The classics department file also includes two articles by Sihler. The geology department file describes the search for a successor to John J. Stevenson. Examination questions pertain to various departments. Material in all folders is arranged in chronological order.</p><p>The professional schools files contain material about the Graduate School (Graduate Seminary), Law School, School of Applied Science (Engineering), University Medical College (University and Bellevue Medical College), the New York American Veterinary College, the School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance, and the School of Pedagogy. Correspondence, reports and printed material comprises the documents found for most schools. In 1899, the chemical and physical laboratories became part of the School of Applied Science. Material for the two laboratories before and after 1899, however, is found in the University College folders of the collection. Letters from applicants for faculty positions in the School of Pedagogy are arranged in alphabetical order; material in all other folders is arranged chronologically.</p><p>The Graduate School (Graduate Seminary) records consist of correspondence and reports, some of which are from John D. Prince, dean of the school, 1895-1902. Theological studies material includes an 1890 agreement between N.Y.U. and the Union Theological Seminary.</p><p>The Law School files include correspondence from Austin Abbott and Clarence D. Ashley, deans of the schools, 1891-1896 and 1896-1916 respectively. There is limited information about the Women's Law Class and no material on the Metropolis Law School. (For information on these subjects, see Records of the Women's Law Class and the Womens Legal Aid Society, and Records of the Metropolis Law School, in the New York University Archives).</p><p>The School of Applied Sciences (Engineering) records include correspondence and reports from Charles H. Snow, dean of the school, 1899-1930, dating from as early as 1892.</p><p>The University Medical College files contain information about the merger between the University Medical College and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1898, the subsequent Loomis Laboratory lawsuit, and the proposed affiliation with the New York Homeopathic College. Correspondence from Egbert LeFevre, dean of the school, 1898-1914, and Herman M. Biggs; financial records and printed material also are included in these files. The financial records describe the physical facilities of the school and include correspondence with Andrew Carnegie about the Carnegie Laboratory.</p><p>The New York American Veterinary College files contain correspondence about the establishment of the school, legislation affecting the college's operation, reports, lists of students, and printed material.</p><p>The School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance records consist of correspondence of Charles W. Haskins, first dean of the school 1900-1903, and partner in the accounting firm of Haskins and Sells. Many of the documents, including faculty correspondence, financial information, course descriptions, printed material, and newspaper clippings, pertain to the establishment of the school.</p><p>The School of Pedagogy material provides information about the 1901 controversy over admissions standards which led to mass faculty resignations. In addition, some documents describe MacCracken's role as acting dean from 1901 to 1904. There is virtually no information about the Summer School.</p><p>The Women's Advisory Committee material relates primarily to the operation of the School of Pedagogy, including information about the 1901 controversy, faculty appointments, courses, and finances. Minute books covering the period 1890 to 1911 provide much information about the committee's activities.</p><p>Special programs/facilities includes information about the Deems lectures, the Bermuda biological station, various N.Y.U. libraries, and limited material concerning the Hall of Fame.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref16" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Vice Chancellor's Office</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662502</unitid></did><c id="aspace_ref17" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence re Appointment at New York University</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662503</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1884/1884" type="inclusive">1884</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_f57cddf86f264fc1bca5460f33be7a28" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998094]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_f57cddf86f264fc1bca5460f33be7a28" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref18" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Annual Report</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662504</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1887/1887" type="inclusive">1887</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_5c90d4fe6bda1ecd74f21f5e478a51d3" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998094]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_5c90d4fe6bda1ecd74f21f5e478a51d3" type="Folder">2</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref19" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Chancellor's Office</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662505</unitid></did><c id="aspace_ref20" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662506</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1910" type="inclusive">1892-1910</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_1a063ce125fb857f6e551f3d005f2ad9" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998094]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_1a063ce125fb857f6e551f3d005f2ad9" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref21" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Art History (Wallace Wood)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662507</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1895/1909" type="inclusive">1895-1909</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_2c920f7b056e16832ef3563f0b667bcc" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998094]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_2c920f7b056e16832ef3563f0b667bcc" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref22" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Astronomy (Edward S.

Washington Square material relates to the construction, furnishing, and rental of Main Building, which was designed by the architect, Alfred Zucker and constructed in 1894. The files include extensive material documenting the lease agreements on the building between the University and the American Book Company.</p><p>Records concerning the University Heights property are divided into three categories: real estate, building and construction, and furnishing and rental.</p><p>Real estate material describes the purchase of property from the Mali and Schwab estates, as well as the Ohio Society's assistance in obtaining property originally belonging to Loring Andrews. Limited correspondence about the sale or rental of property is included.</p><p>Building construction, furnishing, and maintenance files include internal memoranda and reports from the building committee, which consisted of members of the University Council, and correspondence with McKim, Meade and White, the principal architects at University Heights. MacCracken's correspondence with Stanford White documents the design of Gould Memorial Library and the Hall of Fame Colonnade. Also included in the records is correspondence and plans with various contractors and builders of the buildings at University Heights.</p><p>Municipal improvements and services records consist of correspondence suggesting the desire of the area's residents to improve city services and to establish such cultural institutions as the Presbyterian church and a branch library. The notebook of the church, minutes of meetings, and some financial information. Printed material includes flyers for the sale of lots, as well as programs for the opening day celebrations in 1895.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref194" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Washington Square</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662678</unitid></did><c id="aspace_ref195" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Plans for construction</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662679</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1893" type="inclusive">1892-1893</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_620e9f1b3e95c7328aa23450c9c662a5" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_620e9f1b3e95c7328aa23450c9c662a5" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref196" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Plans for preserving original University building</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662680</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1892" type="inclusive">ca. 1892</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_a7257e66219ffb4f797cc87c58001025" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_a7257e66219ffb4f797cc87c58001025" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref197" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Sewerage agreement</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662681</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1892" type="inclusive">1892</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_b3e82128e08ffb884cab23e68145b0b8" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_b3e82128e08ffb884cab23e68145b0b8" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref198" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>McKim, Mead &amp; White</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662682</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1892/1892" type="inclusive">1892</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_62453fdec1296eef506ed20b2e1e3b4e" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_62453fdec1296eef506ed20b2e1e3b4e" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref199" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Rentals</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662683</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1893/1900" type="inclusive">1893, 1900</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_2a705e3b7260c0c805b1fb54029506c5" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_2a705e3b7260c0c805b1fb54029506c5" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref200" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Alfred Zucker; American Book Co.</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662684</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1894/1894" type="inclusive">1894</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_755d79f782cea3bc5dceeb2677e25a0b" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_755d79f782cea3bc5dceeb2677e25a0b" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref201" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Alfred Zucker; American Book Co.</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662685</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1895/1895" type="inclusive">1895</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_10f44e163726e83d887f8fbd69d8ca82" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_10f44e163726e83d887f8fbd69d8ca82" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref202" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Alfred Zucker; American Book Co.</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/662686</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1896/1896" type="inclusive">1896</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_c6932e75d7618aa803a642db78336099" label="Mixed Materials [31142062998243]" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_c6932e75d7618aa803a642db78336099" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref203" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Alfred Zucker; Leslie J.
